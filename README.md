# gbQuake4
gbQuake4 is an attempt at merging the Quake 4 SDK into my own gbDoom3 port to produce a Quake 4 source port

# status
gbQuake4 can be built (as both x64 and x86) but can only be currently played as a 32bit game.  Work in ongoing to get it x64 compatible throughout the codebase.

# playing
gbQuake4 needs the GOG/Steam releases and cannot be played with the original 2005 release CD ROM.  This is due to differences in structure and location of game data within the pak files and in some scripts.

# buggy bug bugs
Lots of bugs.  However, the most game-breaking ones are that 'some' doors stay closed and won't open (collision issues) and the menu system is unusable due to it not displaying correctly.  Other than that, it is playable.

# contributing
Code, PR, merge and repeat.  No issues with me.
